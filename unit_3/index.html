	<h2>Create your own fundraiser to help provide a "home away from home" for children and their familes battling pediatric cancer.</h2>
	<p>Ronald McDonald House New York is a special place where kids with cancer can just be kids. It's a place where families can live together during the most stressful times in their lives, and where families can look to each other for additional care and support.</p>
	<p>Located in close proximity to 19 major medical and cancer treatment centers, we serve families from all over the world. The House can accommodate 84 families at a time and is filled to capacity nearly every night. It costs $295 per night to house each family, yet we only ask families for a donation of $35 per night. No family is turned away for their inability to pay.</p>
	<p>Our doors stay open due to funding from the community, which is why we need your help! Starting your own fundraiser can make a big difference in the lives of families who are coming to New York City as a last resort for serious pediatric cancers. Together, we can help provide them with a "home away from home," even during the most difficult time in their lives.</p>
