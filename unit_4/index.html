			<h2>Why We Need Your Help</h2>
			<p>Ronald McDonald House New York is a special place where kids with cancer can just be kids. It's a place where families can live together during the most stressful times in their lives, and where families can look to each other for additional care and support.</p>
			<p>Located in close proximity to 19 major medical and cancer treatment centers, we serve families from all over the world. The House can accommodate 84 families at a time and is filled to capacity nearly every night. It costs $295 to house each family, each night. While families who stay at the House are asked to donate $35 per night, no family is ever turned away for their inability to pay.</p>
			<p>The rest of the House's costs are entirely supported by foundations, corporations, and individuals. Starting your own fundraiser can make a big difference in the lives of families who are coming to New York City as a last resort for serious pediatric cancers. Together, we can help provide them with a "home away from home," even during the most difficult time in their lives.</p>
